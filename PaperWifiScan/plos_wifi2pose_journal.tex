	\section*{Introduction}
	Wi-Fi is one of the most common network mediums nowadays. Pervasively, it is used for establishing a wireless network to connect to the internet. But, there are still many more functions Wi-Fi is good at. Wi-Fi can also be applied in fields beside connecting to the internet according to its stability being upgraded continuously. Decent Wi-Fi connectivity can extract more data other than the data to be transmitted like concentration, speed, obstacle between the transmission. Those can be composed to be many useful applications like Localization, Activity classification and etc.
	
	
	Camera is a very good tool for monitoring things and is being used as a very effective data collector for mapping to the ground truth to create many popular machine-learning-based usable models like Pose estimation, Text segmentation, Object detection and many more. However, camera may be unavoidably judged as a serious privacy infringement since the data obtained like photos or videos are too clear and possess too much information that might be used in a bad way.
	
	
	There are many works tried to extract those extractable features like videos does from Wi-Fi. But, they are mostly working with very specific tools and Network Interface Card (NIC) connected to a laptop running Linux that is currently one of the ways allowing to obtain fine-grain Channel State Information (CSI), the descriptive data of the  Wi-Fi propagating in that environment. Those limitations significantly decrease simplicity of implementation. It is hard for public demonstration and intregration with many updated tools in operating system like Windows or OSX.
	
	
	Actually, there are other existing ways for obtaining the CSI. One is from a ubiquitously used microprocessor, ESP32. which is still not much explored in Wi-Fi exploiting field. It is simple to implement and can be easily integrated with other tools in many platforms due to its massively produced external tools. 
	
	Human pose estimation is one of the most popular topics in machine-learning-based field. It can be used for visualization directly and also applied for further applications like Game-controlling, Activity classification, Violence detection and many more. Most of the models extract human pose from videos which are taken from camera which conduct privacy issue like statement above. We are expecting to extract human pose from Wi-Fi CSI to solve the issue. So, this paper proposes a machine-learning-based model to create a mapping rule from Wi-Fi CSI to 3D moving human pose estimation by using ESP32.
	
	
	\section*{Background}
	
	\subsection*{Pose Estimation}
	
	There are many machine-learning-based human body pose estimation tools proposed and available online. Those can be found in both 2D and 3D. In our paper, we choose a Light-weight 3D pose estimation to create annotations due to its simplicity and the hypothesis that 3D should suit the most in our work. The project can be found at [github-lw3d] and is based on \cite{bib4} and \cite{bib5}. Its job is to simply create 3D human pose annotation from videos. Then, feed to our works training process as annotations.
	
	
	\subsection*{Wi-Fi}\label{wifi}
	
	Wi-Fi is a well-known connectivity with no wire needed (wireless). It has been used as a medium for connecting to the internet for over 10 years. However, the Wi-Fi is the name covering IEEE 802.11 n/g/ac protocols. It delivers data through 2.4/5GHz frequency with multiple channels. The bandwidth in each channel is 22MHz. the data are to be transmitted  parallelly with multiplexing technique named orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Each carrier may propagate to a receiver with encountering many obstacles. The effect of that situation is the Doppler Effect.
	So, Channel State Information (CSI) is represented as physical layer indicator that can be used to investigate how each channel propagate to the receiver or back to the transmitter.
	
	If a sender sends data to a receiver through Wi-Fi, the data will be surely not transmitted without any loss.
	
	
	
	\subsection*{CSI data}\label{CSI}
	As mentioned in \nameref{wifi} that data propagating to the receiver while touching surrounding environment, the CSI is a variation of the data. The CSI can  be found at both sender and receiver since receiver may transmit data back. In this paper, we consider to mainly use CSI at the transmitter. Let the sender use the modulation method of 16-quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM) which one carrier can carry 4 bits. When the sender needs to send a `1111', the modulation returns $x=1+1i$. Then, transmit to the receiver. At the receiver, let the obtained data is $y=0.8+0.9i$. So, the CSI can be computed by the variation $h=y/x=0.2+3.4i$.
	
	Human body is literally water which reflect radio wave like Wi-Fi. \cite{wangF}, \cite{liuJ} and \cite{chowdhuryTZ} have proven that human body can affect the CSI.
	
	\subsubsection*{ESP32}\label{ESP32}
	ESP32 is a very popular single-board computer (SBC). With its affordable price and many available additional tools, ESP32 is commonly used in Internet of Things field. Moreover, it can be applied in research field. Quantitative CSI can be obtained from Wi-Fi in ESP according to \cite{atifM}. The number of available subcarriers in ESP32 is 64.
	
	According to the detail about Wi-Fi mentioned in \nameref{wifi}, the Wi-Fi in ESP32 has some limitation. It supports only 2.4GHz frequency and can be set only one channel over a connection. The bandwidth of each channel is 22MHz. The CSI can be both obtain from Access point (AP) and Station (STA) as shown in Fig~\ref{fig:ESP32CSI01}.
	The frequency of each channel is as 802.11 standard.

	\end{figure}
	
	\iffalse
	\subsubsection*{Faraday cage}
	Faraday cage is invented by Michael Faraday in 1836. It is an enclosure to block electromagnetic fields. It is made of conducting material which can affect any radio frequency (e.g. Wi-Fi) to be unable to pass through.

	\section*{Materials and methods}
	
	\subsection*{Concept}
	\label{concept}
	
	\begin{figure}[htbp]
		
		\centerline{\includegraphics[width=70mm,scale=0.5]{ESP32CSI02.png}}
		\caption{2 different CSIs resulted from corresponding human poses.}
		\label{fig:ESP32CSI02}
	\end{figure}
	
	Other famous proposed works like \cite{wangF} \cite{liuJ} and \cite{hernandezSM} focus on line-of-sight (LOS) in between AP and STA while our work uses 2 directional Wi-Fi antennae and focus on reflection from human body as shown in Fig~\ref{fig:ESP32CSI02} on the left.
	
	
	The reason we name ``Moving Pose Estimation" instead of ``Pose Estimation" is that CSI is not only affected by human body but mainly by overall environment. This means that 2 corresponding human poses can result obviously different CSIs if the environment around are not exactly the same as shown in Fig~\ref{fig:ESP32CSI02}.
	
	
	So, the definite detection of human standing still in every environment is nearly impossible since the CSI of that situation may be found exactly matched to a CSI of the environment that a big bottle of water placed in front of ESP32.
	In short, if it does not move, we do not know if it is human.
	
	Meanwhile, the moving pose is totally different because we focus on its change instead. The example of mapping CSI's change to Activity Classification can be found in \cite{chowdhuryTZ} and \cite{zouH}. Our work does likewise but focusing on Pose Estimation instead of Activity Classification.
	
	In different environment, the CSIs are  different. But, the corresponding moving pose may affect to the same changing pattern of CSI. This hypothesis is investigated in the upcoming parts.
	
	
	
	
	
	
	All steps of training method is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:TRAINSTEP}.

	\end{figure}
	
	
	
	\subsection*{Pre-processing}\label{Processing}
	
	\subsubsection*{CSI Resampling}
	
	
	As mentioned in \nameref{ESP32}, there are 64 subcarriers in CSI data from ESP32 but there are only 52 those are usable while the rest are null. So, we can construst a tensor of $1 \times 52$ to represent each CSI. We are to map CSI from the ESP32 to 3D human pose annotation from a camera. The sampling rate of the camera are set to 30Hz. So, we have 30 human pose annotations for one second. For the ESP32, the sampling rate is originally unpredictable and not constant but it is running around 120Hz. So we do a process called ``Resampling" to obtain CSI at rate 30Hz in order to synchronize timestamps to each human pose annotation.
	
	An example of CSI Resampling is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:CSIResampling01}. The top graph shows that the the original CSI is logged unstably. The bottom one is to pick a timestamp at rate 30Hz and calculated each with the closet data from the original with a simple mathamatical weight equation as in Eq.~\ref{eq:CSIResampling01} in order to predict CSI at timestamp corresponding to each human pose annotation.
	
	\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
	& CSI_{now} = CSI_{before} \\ 
	& + \left(  \frac{ts_{now}-ts_{before}}{ts_{after}-ts_{before}}  \times (CSI_{after}-CSI_{before})   \right),
	\label{eq:CSIResampling01}
	\end{aligned}
	\end{equation}
	where $ts_{now}$, $ts_{before}$, $ts_{after}$ are desired timestamp, timestamp at the closest CSI before the desired timestamp and timestamp at the closest CSI after the desired timestamp respectively. And, $CSI_{now}$, $CSI_{before}$, $CSI_{after}$ are CSI at the desired timestamp, CSI before the desired timestamp and CSI after the desired timestamp respectively.
	
	\begin{figure}[htbp]
		\centerline{\includegraphics[width=70mm,scale=0.5]{CSIResampling03.png}}
		\caption{An example of CSI resampling.}
		\label{fig:CSIResampling01}
	\end{figure}
	
	Thus, we are able to map each CSI sample to one 3D human pose annotation at the corresponding timestamp.
	
	
	\subsubsection*{Pose Estimation and PAM formation}
	
	
	\begin{figure}[htbp]
		\centerline{\includegraphics[width=20mm,scale=0.5]{POSEkeypoint01.png}}
		\caption{19 keypoints of human pose.}
		\label{fig:POSEkeypoint}
	\end{figure}
	
	
	
	We use [github-lw3d] to estimate 3D human pose from videos as stated above. the estimation gives us a $19 \times 3$ matrix for each image. The $19 \times 3$ matrix are used as an annotation where $19$ is for keypoints in human body and $3$ is for 3 axes coordination as shown in Fig~\ref{fig:POSEkeypoint}. But, the annotation can still possess too much independency. Some alignment of keypoints may lead to some impossible pose e.g. body keypoint found very far from neck keypoint or head keypoint attached to hip keypoint. We assume those poses are not possible for normal human pose. To preserve those constraints, we form a pose adjacent matrix (PAM) from an original $19\times3$ matrix. the PAM is applied for all x, y and z axes. Each are to be form their $19\times19$ matrix by the following equations.
	
	\begin{equation}
	x_{i,j}' = \begin{cases}
	x_i-x_j &\text{$i\neq j$}\\
	x_i &\text{$i=j$}\\
	\end{cases}
	\label{eq:xPAM}
	\end{equation},
	\begin{equation}
	y_{i,j}' = \begin{cases}
	y_i-y_j &\text{$i\neq j$}\\
	y_i &\text{$i=j$}\\
	\end{cases}
	\label{eq:yPAM}
	\end{equation}
	and
	\begin{equation}
	z_{i,j}' = \begin{cases}
	z_i-x_j &\text{$i\neq j$}\\
	z_i &\text{$i=j$}\\
	\end{cases}
	\label{eq:zPAM}
	\end{equation}.
	
	The PAM is finally a $3\times19\times19$ matrix created from 3 matrices of $x'$,$y'$ and $z'$ stacked.
	Apparently, one PAM represents one human pose.
	
	
	
	Conclusively, we are making a model by mapping a sequence of $1\times52$ matrix from CSI to each sequence of $ 19 \times 3 \times 3 $ PAM from moving human pose annotation with the corresponding timestamp as shown in Fig~\ref{fig:STEP01}. 
	
	\begin{figure}[htbp]
		\centerline{\includegraphics[width=90mm,scale=0.5]{STEP05.png}}
		\caption{A mapping rule from CSI frames to 3D human poses.}
		\label{fig:STEP01}
	\end{figure}
	
	
	
	\subsection*{Processing}
	
	
	\subsubsection*{Mapping CSI and PAM}
	Let $D$ be a set of synchronized pose and CSI data package. Each pair has corresponding timestamp.
	
	\begin{equation}
	D =  {(C_t, P_t), t \in [1, n]},
	\label{eq:Dataset}
	\end{equation} where  $n$ is a number of pairs, $C$ is for CSI data from ESP32, $P$ is for PAM annotation as the ground truth, $t$ is the timestamp index when those 2 were collected.
	
	
	
	\subsubsection*{Grouping By Sequence Size}
	
	Let $\sigma$ be an adjustable window size. $\sigma$ size of $D$ are fed to the model solely. So,  $\sigma \le n$. And, Let $m$ be the number of feeding iteration, $m = \lfloor \frac{n}{\sigma} \rfloor$.
	
	
	\subsubsection*{Forming Network Layer}
	
	The network swallow $m$ training data as an input, where each is a sequencial set of $(C_t,P_t)$ at a corresponding timestamp with size $\sigma$.
	Let $\Gamma$ be a representation of each sequencial set.
	
	\begin{equation}
	\Gamma =  {(C_u, P_u), u \in [1, \sigma]},
	\label{eq:SubDataset}
	\end{equation}
	where $u$ is the timestamp index when those 2 were collected. Apparently, the number of $\Gamma$ is $m$.
	
	
	As the $\Gamma$ is a sequencial set with size $\sigma$, we assume that Long-short term memory (LSTM) \cite{hochreiterS} is suitable for this type of data.
	
	\iffalse
	\paragraph*{(Optional) CSI Feature Extractor}
	We may extract feature from the CSI before feed it to the model. Or ignore it and feed original CSI to the model directly.
	\fi
	
	\paragraph*{CSI Feature Engineering}
	As mentioned in \nameref{concept}, CSI ($C$) value implies environment where signal propagating. So, we need to ignore it and focus only on its change in order to universalize the circumstance. It means CSI variousity makes the model not to be applicable in every environment. To solve it, we simply sequentially substract $C_u$  in each $\Gamma$ backward to preserve only how CSI changes over each sequence by the following equation,
	
	
	\begin{equation}
	C_u =  \begin{cases}
	\text{all } 0 &\text{$u = 1$}\\
	C_u - C_{u-1} &\text{$u > 1 $}\\
	\end{cases}, C_u \in \Gamma.
	\label{eq:CSIFeatureEn}
	\end{equation}
	
	
	
	\paragraph*{CSI Sequence to Pose Sequence (CSPS)}
	
	The summation of layers is shown in Table~\ref{table:CSPS}.
	It is designed to shape a CSI Sequence ( $\sigma \times 52$ tensor) to a predicted Pose Sequence ( $\sigma \times 3\times 19\times 19$ tensor).

	\end{table}
	
	
	We first use Bidirectional LSTM as an encoder layer with the input size of $(\sigma,52)$ to satisfy dimension of sequential $C_u$ in $\Gamma$.
	Then, the repeat vector is added with time $\sigma$ to make the model treat with correct time-step. Afterward, we place a decoder layer with another Bidirectional LSTM. 
	
	Next, we dense the decoder to be $1083$ where can be reshaped into $3\times 19\times 19$ later.
	
	Lastly,  the TimeDistributed layer is used in order to make the model treat the output for each time-step individually.

	and asked them to do casual daily actions in two rooms of the campus, one laboratory room and one
	class room. Floor plans and data collection positions are illustrated in Fig. 8. During the actions, we
	run the system in Fig. 3 to record CSI samples and videos, simultaneously. For each volunteer, data
	of his first 80% recording is used to train the networks, and data of the last 20% recording is used to
	test the networks. The data size of training and testing are 79496 and 19931, respectively))
	
	
	\subsection*{Error Metric}
	
	
	
	Percentage of Correct Keypoint (PCK) is widely used to evaluate the performance of human pose estimation according to \cite{wangF}.
	
	\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
	PCK_i@a = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N}
	I(
	\frac{\mid \mid  pd_i \text{ - } gt_i \mid \mid^2_2}{\sqrt{rh^2+lh^2}}  \le a ),
	\label{eq:PCK}
	\end{aligned}
	\end{equation}
	
	
	where $I$(·) is a binary indicator that outputs 1 while true and 0 while false, 
	$N$ is the number of frames, $i$ is the index of keypoints that $i \in {1, 2, ..., 19}$. The $rh$ and
	$lh$ are for the positions of the right shoulder and the left hip from the ground truth, respectively.
	So, the ${\sqrt{rh^2+lh^2}}$ is  considered as the length of the upper limb from the ground truth, which is used to normalize the prediction error length
	$ \mid \mid pd_i \text{ - } gt_i \mid \mid _2^2$, and $pd_i$ and $gt_i$ are coordinates of prediction and ground-truth at the keypoint $i$ respectively.
	
	
	
	\subsection*{Experimental Result}
	
	All steps of testing method is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:TESTSTEP}.

	\end{figure}
	
	
	
	
	An evaluation is achieved with  by the algorithm written in Python 3.8. The code is available on $github$.
	An environment under the evaluation is MacBook Pro 2016, 2.6 GHz i7 processor, 16 GB of RAM.
	
	As parameters stated in the previous sections, we demostrate the prediction by the followings.
	
	Table~\ref{table:PCK} and Table~\ref{table:PCK} shows the estimation performance of 19 body keypoints in PCK when $\sigma=15$ and $\sigma=30$ respectively.
